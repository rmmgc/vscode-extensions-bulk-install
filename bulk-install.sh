# Bulk install for VS Code extensions
#
# How it works #
# Script takes a list of extensions provided via .txt file and
# installs them. It will loop over file contents line by line
# so it is important to properly prepare the file.
#
# Prepare extensions list .txt file #
# Create .txt file with all VS Code extensions listed in there.
# Make sure all extensions are added by extension ID which is
# in ${publisher}.${name} format. Every extension should be
# separated with new line.
